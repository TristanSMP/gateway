# Punishment System

On TristanSMP, there is a punishment system. This system is designed to punish players who are breaking the rules.
This is how it works:

1. Player reports another player for breaking a rule, by making a ticket (The example were using today is that a player stole from another player.)
   ![Ticket](/images/report.gif)
2. A staff member will review the accused player's actions by asking screenshots for `/co i` database records or they will get their own evidence.

3. The staff member will add the accused player to the current ticket and will try to resolve the issue between them.
   In our example the player that stole needs to return the items or risk being revoked as a member.
